				- Superposition and Polysemanticity
				   - Neuron polysemanticity is the observed phenomena that many neurons seem to fire (have large, positive activations) on multiple unrelated concepts. Superposition is a specific explanation for neuron (or attention head) polysemanticity, where a neural network represents more sparse features than there are neurons (or number of/dimension of attention heads) in near-orthogonal directions. 
				- Neel nanda pioneered this stuff [Neel Nanda](https://www.neelnanda.io/?offset=1601395744946&reversePaginate=true)
				- Einsum and einops to avoid bugs 
				- Induction heads
				   - The induction head pays attention to a token in the past (let's call it A).
				   - It then looks for the next occurrence of A in the sequence.
				   - If it finds A again, it predicts that the token that followed A the first time will likely follow A again.
				   - so sort of like how we "induce" something or do an induction proof. its not direct, but we can use our axioms to declare that since something "over there" happened, we infer something "here" also happened similarly. 
				   - example: "Also did you know..." - "Also lets jump back to..."

						   - for local minecraft nn, consider implementing implicit learning so i can simply type a certain key when i come across a type of mob. then the neural net can learn what im looking at. the real problem comes in when we need to draw a bounding box. if we only click when looking at it, the neural net may not learn explicit feature that defined a mob (green color change defines a creeper). still useful though

					- MY QUESTIONS TO GROK:
					   - if i wanted to completely automate CUDA kernel generation with reasoning LLMs. my thought process is a bit scramble but looks like this: you ask the llm to generate a faster kernel with a text prompt (optional) along with some pytorch code. you take some input shape, do a bunch of operations and get an output shape to the final result. the idea is instead of seperately launching fast kernels, we fuse them into a SINGLE fast kernel. going lower level a model like deepseek-r1 would output some GPU code and we would have a verifier to ensure the gpu results match pytorch results. we would also have a speedup counter to see how much better the current optimization was from the past state. if the results dont match, we would feed it back through a loop where the prompt is customized to fix the script and encourage different approaches to figuring out why they dont match (error checking macros, stride/indexing errors, incorrect reductions, numerical instability, etc). once the results do match, we compare performance. performance is the other feedback loop which consists of a different set of prompts to optimize further (ill design this later). we could reformat the prompt each time for both ensuring correctness, and that the increase in performance during the optimization phase is done properly. ideally we would port each WORKING optimzation to different scripts with a specific name generated at random (adjective_noun). ANYWAYS... curious to hear your feedback on this
						- suppose this would be easier if we easier put more effort into a finetuning (SFT) a reasoning model on the CUDA compatibility matrix, device stats like ./deviceQuery from cuda-samples, etc. or use RAG, or just have a system of agents that places this info directly into the context window and figures out step by step (different agents have different system prompts as to how they take data and think up some good optimizations)
						- we actually would only need maybe flash attention2 and 3, thunderkittens, cutlass, and a couple (2) other projects. the rest could be RL because output verification and performance optimization are VERY EASY when it comes to crafting reward functions. like kernelbench from stanford for example: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10517v1](../%5B2502.10517v1%5D%20KernelBench_%20Can%20LLMs%20Write%20Efficient%20GPU%20Kernels_.md)
